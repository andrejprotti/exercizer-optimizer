Some important allies that helped me with this but don't show up in the imports: rubocop and pry!

Cool upgrades I perceive:
- Factory Girl to make the tests cleaner
- Docker+Docker-Compose (could really help with local testing and running if it were to become a micro-service in the future)
- Validating inputs and more extensive stress testing (maybe with chaos monkey?)
- As much optimization as possible regarding cyclomatic complexity
- Prepare it for an API style microservice (inputs and outputs in JSON)! Could be cool to show it on the front-end, specially if there's some sort of GraphQL already around
